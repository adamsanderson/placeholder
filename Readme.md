# placeholder.css

  Simple CSS image placeholders.

## Installation
Either install placeholder.css as a component:

    $ component install adamsanderson/placeholder

Or link to it after your normal styles:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="placeholder.css">

## Usage

Include `placeholder.css` in your project, and then markup your images like this:

    <img class='placeholder' width='50%' height='100'/>

If you include a `title`, that text will be displayed on the placeholder image.

## Browser Support

Internet Explorer 8 and 9 will display the placeholder with an image icon instead of the placeholder's dimensions.  
Doubtless there is a workaround, but I haven't found it yet.
